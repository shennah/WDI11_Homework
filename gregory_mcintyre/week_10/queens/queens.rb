# Queen Attack

# In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row,
# column, or diagonal.

# A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

# So if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at (5, 6),
# then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

# ```plain
# O O O O O O O O
# O O O O O O O O
# O O O W O O O O
# O O O O O O O O
# O O O O O O O O
# O O O O O O B O
# O O O O O O O O
# O O O O O O O O
# ```

# You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
# In this case, that answer would be yes, they can,
# because both pieces share a diagonal.
