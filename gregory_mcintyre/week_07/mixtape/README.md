PLAN FOR WED

* Add a router
* Define the route for the index and show actions (Rails terminology)
  * Does it print console.log statements when we visit those paths?
* Add a lyrics button on each song in the list
	* Add a click handler to the lyrics button
	* When clicked, call navigate
* Observe that our router gets called

* Add a song lyrics template
* Add a song lyrics view (Backbone.View)
	* Render the template
* Use the song lyrics view, to implement the router action

- Show/hide parts of the HTML to make it work like pages
