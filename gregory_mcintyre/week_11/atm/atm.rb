# This ATM is stocked with 50 and 20 dollar notes. You type in a number and
# then it delivers 50 and 20 dollar notes to you. It always gives you the
# smallest number of notes possible. If it cannot provide the number requested
# using 50 and 20 dollar notes, then it returns nil.
#
# Tips:
#
# * Run the tests with `ruby atm.rb`
# * Add more tests if you need to.
# * A *backtracking* algorithm will help satisfy the last test case.
#
# BONUS:
#
# * Make your ATM stocked with $1, $5, $15 and $28 notes.
#
# BONUS:
# * If you didn't use recursion, use it. If you did, try writing the code
#   without it.
