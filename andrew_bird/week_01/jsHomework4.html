/*Part 1, Rectangle

Given the following a rectangle object like the one below, write the following functions:

isSquare - Returns whether the rectangle is a square or not
area - Returns the area of the rectangle
perimeter - Returns the perimeter of the rectangle

var rectangle = {
  length: 4,
  width: 4
};

*/

	var area = rec.length * rec.width;

Part 2, Triangle

Given the following a triangle object like the one below, write the following functions:

isEquilateral - Returns whether the triangle is equilateral or not
isIsosceles - Returns whether the triangle is isosceles or not
area - Returns the area of the Triangle
isObtuse - Returns whether the triangle is obtuse or not

/*
JavaScript Bank
In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.

Bank

There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new Account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.

The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.

Accounts

Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an Account to change the balance.

There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.

You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.

Tips

Don't overthink this. Shorter code is probably the answer.

Bonus

Ensure that the accounts cannot have negative values.
Write a 'transfer' on the bank that allows you to transfer amounts between two accounts.

// Create object bank which contins array accounts
var bank = {name: 'General Assembly Bank',
	accounts: [],

// function to create an object account and add it to the array of accounts
	addAccount : function(first, last, amount) {
		this.accounts.push(new Account(first, last, amount));
		},
// function to show the total balance of all accounts by iterating through each object in the array and summing the .amount value.		
	showTotal : function() {
			var tot = 0;
			for(var i = 0; i < this.accounts.length; i++){
				tot += this.accounts[i].amount;
				}
				return tot;
		}
	
	}


	//}

// function to create an object account, which has functions to deposit and withdraw form the balance
function Account(first, last, amount) {
	this.firstName = first;
	this.lastName = last;
	this.amount = amount;
	this.deposit = function(depositAmount) {
		this.amount += depositAmount;
		return "$" + depositAmount + " deposited. Your balance is $" + this.amount;
	}
	this.withdraw = function(withdrawAmount) {
		if(withdrawAmount <= this.amount) {
		this.amount -= withdrawAmount;
		return "$" + withdrawAmount + " withdrawn from account."
		} else {
			return "your balance is not high enough for that."
		}
	}
}

// create some accounts
bank.addAccount("Roger", "Federer", 145236);
bank.addAccount("Tim", "Minchin", 20);
bank.addAccount("Freddy", "Mercury", 5);
bank.addAccount("Dame", "Edna", 2);

console.log(bank);

//view the accounts
console.log(bank.accounts[0]);
console.log(bank.accounts[1]);
console.log(bank.accounts[2]);
console.log(bank.accounts[3]);

// show total
console.log(bank.showTotal());

//deoposit and withdraw to accounts

console.log(bank.accounts[1].deposit(4));
console.log(bank.accounts[0].withdraw(145200));
console.log(bank.accounts[1].deposit(4));
console.log(bank.accounts[3].withdraw(1000));

// show accounts and bank total
console.log(bank.accounts[0]);
console.log(bank.accounts[1]);
console.log(bank.accounts[2]);
console.log(bank.accounts[3]);

console.log("tot =");
console.log(bank.showTotal());
